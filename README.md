a1_Awesome_Intents
==================

I want to feel the freedom of intents -- you're programming a smartphone, you can do almost anything with this.


## Level 1: Basic Intents

At their most fundamental level, Intents are used to open new pages (often return simple succeed/fail results).


This facet of the intents will demo how we can:

1 add listeners and interactivity.
2 check fields of objects and respond intelligently
3 and review the workflow/structure of the android application.

## Level 2: World Wide Web, Map View, and Dial View

Built in views can be accessed via Intents. You can quickly integrate these fancy features into your killer app.


## Level 3: Send Text Messages,  Emails, Start the Camera for Photo, Start the Camera For Video, Start Phone Calls.

* Phone Tracker: Send a GPS location of your Phone to your email address/friend/sms
* Program a Delayed Timer for Your Phone: learn how to use the time and camera settings
* Delayed Caller: have a phone call begin after a set amount of time has taken place.




#### Elective Course, Android App Styling

The basics of Android App Styling will be covered int the 101 course, but to make your app stand out amongst the rest, take the Styling Elective 
to add the shiny fx and transistions to garner reputation for your UI.

This course is meant to be taken (potentially) in conjunction with the Android 101 or Android 102 courses.
